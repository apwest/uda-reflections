When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you want to collaborate with others or just make your code available for others to see

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So it doesn't update your project while you are in the middle of something causing it to break

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A clone is for making a copy of a repository you have permissions to change.
    A fork is for copying a repository that you don't have permissions to change.
    A branch is for organizing code within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It would allow you to work offline locally, but still have the ability to compare/merge with origin/master.
