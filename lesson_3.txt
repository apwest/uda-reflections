When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you want to collaborate with others or just make your code available for others to see

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So it doesn't update your project while you are in the middle of something causing it to break
