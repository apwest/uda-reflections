How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a conceptual area for keeping (related) files that you want to commit together. A working directory is where you keep all of your files for the repo and the repository is for keeping track of your commits/files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    You can have many unrelated changes going on in your working directory and use the staging area to group logically related changes to commit together.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
